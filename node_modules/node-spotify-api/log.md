# LIRI Bot

### Overview

In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

### Background

1. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

2. GitHub repository is called liri-node-app.

3. To retrieve the data for this app, we send requests to the Bands in Town, Spotify and OMDB APIs using the below Node packages.

To run this liri.js node application you will need to type in 
one of the following commands followed by the search parameter in node via the terminal:

   * ` node liri.js concert-this arist or bandname`

   * `spotify-this-song song`

   * `movie-this movie`

   * `do-what-it-says type a request`

### What Each Command Should Do

1. `node liri.js concert-this <artist/band name here>`
    You will see the below results:
     * Name of the venue

     * Venue location

     * Date of the Event (use moment to format this as "MM/DD/YYYY")

2. `node liri.js spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`
    You will see the below results (in the termina;/bash window):
     * Artist(s)

     * The song's name

     * A preview link of the song from Spotify

     * The album that the song is from

   * If no song is provided then your program will default to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.

   3. `node liri.js movie-this '<movie name here>'`

   * This will output the following information to your terminal/bash window:

     ```
       * Title of the movie.
       * Year the movie came out.
       * IMDB Rating of the movie.
       * Rotten Tomatoes Rating of the movie.
       * Country where the movie was produced.
       * Language of the movie.
       * Plot of the movie.
       * Actors in the movie.
     ```

   * If the user doesn't type a movie in, the program will output data for the movie 'Mr. Nobody.'

     * If you haven't watched "Mr. Nobody," then you should: <http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/>

     * It's on Netflix!

    4. `node liri.js do-what-it-says`

   * Using the `fs` Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI's commands.

     * It should run `spotify-this-song` for "I Want it That Way," as follows the text in `random.txt`.

     * Edit the text in random.txt to test out the feature for movie-this and concert-this.

     Have fun!
